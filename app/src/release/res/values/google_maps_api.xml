    TODO: Before you release your application, you need a Google Maps API keyView.

    To do this, you can either add your release keyView credentials to your existing
    keyView, or create a new keyView.

    Note that this file specifies the API keyView for the release build target.
    If you have previously set up a keyView for the debug target with the debug signing certificate,
    you will also need to set up a keyView for your release certificate.

    Follow the directions here:

    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/signup

    Once you have your keyView (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">
        YOUR_KEY_HERE
    </string>
